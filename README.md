### Description
Allows you to execute a command when an NPC is hit with an arrow. Great for making a target practice system

### Installation
Similar to my [other plugin](https://github.com/lucian929/Hypixel-Skyblock-GrapplingHook-Source), you just need to download the source and run "mvn clean install" in the folder with the pom.xml.
