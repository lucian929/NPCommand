### Description
Allows you to execute a command when an NPC is hit with an arrow. Great for making a target practice system

### Installation
Similar to my [other plugin](https://github.com/lucian929/Hypixel-Skyblock-GrapplingHook-Source), you just need to download the source and run "mvn clean install" in the folder with the pom.xml.

## To-do
- ~~Add PlaceholderAPI Support.~~
- ~~Allow firework color to be configurable in config.yml~~
- Make it so that commands can have a random chance to be fired.
- Add a placeholder for how many times you have hit targets.

## Special Thanks
Thanks to [Preware](https://github.com/Preware) for help with the config file.
